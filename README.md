# List Practice

## Directions:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/UCMHS-Gerstein/more-lists.git`
2. Complete the assignments. Recommended order: list-practice.py, fibonacci-exercise.py, shopping-list.py. Remember to run your code to test it
3. Remember to stage and commit after each exercise
4. Push to *your own repository* (directions below)
5. I know you might not finish shopping-list.py, but do your best

## Pushing to your own repository:

1. Go to Github and create a repository called more-lists. You don't need to do anything else on the website, and you don't need to initialize with a readme because you're going to push this repository to the website
2. In your bash console, add a new remote for this repository. This is going to rename my remote to upstream, so you'll still be able to access it if you need to get updates from me. Remember to replace YOU with your username

```shell
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin http://github.com/YOU/more-lists
```

3. Push your changes using `git push origin master`# more-lists
# more-lists
